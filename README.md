Research interests...
- My current research interests include neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience research, with a keen interest in investigating emotion, cognition, and mental health, and their interactions with the brain and body, particularly from an individual differences and developmental perspective! I am also interested in topics in educational neuroscience and personality psychology.

What I am currently working on...
- At the Clinical Brain Lab at NTU, I am currently investigating the effects of an [exercise intervention programme](https://www.clinicalbrain.org/project/ageing/) on cognition in the elderly in Singapore, using the combined modalities of TMS-EEG to measure brain plasticity throughout the course of the intervention.
- I am also involved in an [educational neuroscience project](https://www.clinicalbrain.org/project/translate-neuro/) seeking to develop a [visualisation website](https://navigating-the-adult-learner-brain.vercel.app/) (using ReactJS) to present neuroscience findings on autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to educators. The goal of this website is to allow educators to better understand the brain-behaviour relationships in adults with ASD/ADHD, by helping to visualise the brain regions/networks with their associated behavioural functions.
